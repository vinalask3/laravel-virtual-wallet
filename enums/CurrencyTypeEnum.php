/**
 * CurrencyTypeEnum defines various types of currencies used in the application, such as cryptocurrency and fiat currency.
 * 
 * - **Cryptocurrency**: A type of digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security and operates on decentralized networks without a central authority (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum).
 * - **Fiat Currency**: Traditional money issued by a government, not backed by a physical commodity. Its value is derived from the trust placed in the issuing government (e.g., USD, EUR).
 * 
 * This enum uses the EnumTrait to add additional functionality, such as validation of enum values. Each case represents a specific type of currency.
