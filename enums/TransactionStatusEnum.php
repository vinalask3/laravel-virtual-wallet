 * - **Approved**: Indicates that the transaction has been approved and processed successfully.
 * - **Pending**: Indicates that the transaction is awaiting approval or processing.

 * This enum utilizes the EnumTrait to provide additional functionality, such as validation of enum values. Each case represents a specific transaction status.
